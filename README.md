# Open Trivia Quiz

This was a project created for an assignment in my third year of study. The application is a dynamice web application using the Django framework that hosts quiz tournaments created from Open Trivia's RESTful API. An admin user is able to create tournament objects that conatin a name, start/end date, category and a difficulty. Other users are can log in to view and participate in available tournaments. The site also includes a list of users highscores from previous tournaments.
